# ConAir

ConAir is a really simple Arduino project for measuring the temperature and uploading
it to [TempoDB](http://www.tempo-db.com/). The measurement comes from an Arduino with a thermistor-based potential
divider.

There is a python script which calculates the temperature, and will upload it.
